            <h1>About APIs</h1>
            <p>In computer programming, an application programming interface (API) is a set of subroutine definitions, protocols, and tools for building application software.</p>
            <p>Just as a graphical user interface makes it easier for people to use programs, application programming interfaces make it easier for developers to use certain technologies in building applications.
               By abstracting the underlying implementation and only exposing objects or actions the developer needs, 
               an API simplifies programming. While a graphical interface for an email client might provide a user with a button that performs all the steps 
               for fetching and highlighting new emails, an API for file input/output might give the developer a function that copies a file from one location 
               to another without requiring that the developer understand the file system operations occurring behind the scenes, 
               you can read more about it on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a></p>
